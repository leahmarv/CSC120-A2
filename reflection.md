Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

On this assignment, I kept running into the error that the given module could not be imported when I was testing in my main file. However, I was able to import a test module I made that allowed me to print to the console, so I do understand the concept of importing modules as a part of OOP. What I found online seemed to suggest that there was an error with circular dependencies, although my Computer and Resale_Shop classes never referenced each other and were only referenced in main. As such, my Computer and Resale_Shop classes have the proper attributes, constructors, and methods, but I was unable to test their functioning since I couldn't import the methods.

I would advise anyone taking this course to take advantage of pair programming for this assignment so you have another person to help troubleshoot errors you might encounter.
